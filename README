ManuOS2
=======
Rewrite of the original ManuOS with major improvements. Now featuring protected mode and FAT12 support. 
Successor to the original ManuOS and Lanskern(My first attempt making a kernel). This README is WIP.

What is ManuOS?
===============
ManuOS is a hobby operating system that runs on a x86 PC. It's written in C and uses a small amount of assembly.

How to use ManuOS?
==================
You need to install grub to a fat12 partitioned disk, copy the kernel and grub.cgf to it and boot it.

How to build ManuOS?
====================

Prerequisites
-------------

- gcc
- nasm
- grub
- (optional) qemu

1. Build the kernel with `make build_kernel`
2. Build the image with `make build_image`

Note: You'll get a FAT12 initialization error if you try to boot the image with qemu. 
To make it work, please see (https://wiki.osdev.org/GRUB), section "Disk image instructions". I've tested it and it works.

Third-party libraries
=====================

- FatFs (https://elm-chan.org/fsw/ff/)
