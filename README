ManuOS2
=======
Rewrite of the original ManuOS with major improvements. Now featuring protected mode and FAT12 support. 
Successor to the original ManuOS and Lanskern(My first attempt making a kernel). This README is WIP.

What is ManuOS?
===============
ManuOS is a hobby operating system that runs on a x86 PC. It's written in C and uses a small amount of assembly. 
It uses Lansker-libc(custom written for the OS) as the C library.

Features that currently are implemented:

- Protected mode
- FAT12 support
- GDT & IDT
- Paging(WIP)

TODO:

- Finish paging
- Add filedescriptors
- Usermode(ring 3)
- Task scheduler
- Printf
- Add more syscalls

How to use ManuOS?
==================
You need to install grub to a fat12 partitioned disk, copy the kernel and grub.cgf to it and boot it.

The goal?
=========
Learn how to write an operating system. And also try getting some actual software working. 
This OS isn't going to be anything special or complex. Simplicity is the goal.

How to build ManuOS?
====================

Prerequisites
-------------

- gcc
- nasm
- grub
- mtools and dosfstools
- dd
- (optional) qemu

1. Build the libc with `make libc`
2. Build the kernel with `make kernel`
3. Build the userland with `make userland`
4. Build the image with `sudo make image`, this will build a bootable FAT12 image
You can also use `sudo make image-update` to only update the OS files(useful for development)


Third-party libraries
=====================

- FatFs (https://elm-chan.org/fsw/ff/)
